# param.js

Simple script that allows you to share short link like `example.com?i` and redirect user to anything you want (ex. `example.com?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=bio&utm_campaign=inst`)

## Why

We often have to share our link. Put them in bio, send with messages, attach them to posts. And sometimes we have to put some URL parameters. Like UTM codes. They're clumsy, looooong and they overshadow what we really want to show: our perfect beautiful website address.

[qurle.net?utm_source=github&utm_medium=param-js-readme&utm_campaign=paramjs](https://qurle.net?utm_source=github&utm_medium=param-js-readme&utm_campaign=paramjs) is yuck.

[qurle.net?g](https://qurle.net?g) is much better.

## How to use

Just import and call once!

```
import Params from 'paramsjs'
...
Params(redirect)
```
